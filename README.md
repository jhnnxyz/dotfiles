### ZSH

Zsh will succeed bash as the default shell for MacOS. You can still use bash, as of this writing my bash version 
is 3.2.57, which dates from 2007. This is the bash version included in all versions of macOS, even the newest one. 
The reason that apple included such an old version of bash in its operating system has to do with licensing.
The wayI see it, its your machine and you can upgrade it yourself if you choose to.  

[Zsh](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/zsh_toc.html#SEC_Contents) offers a lot of functionality straight out 
of the box. And one can argue that its better than bash. You decide. I keep my config files clean and choose not 
to clutter my system with bloated frameworks such as oh-my-zsh.
